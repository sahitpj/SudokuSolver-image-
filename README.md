# SudokuSolver-image


The idea is to use image recognition and a machine learning programme for identifying the content ofa sudoku after which we apply the backtracking algorithm to be ble to solve it for us 


The following progarmme consists of two independent parts

1. the image processing part
2. the sudoku solving part

the whole project has been done in python 2 and 3, and the libarries that have been used are
1. NumPy
2. Sklrean
3. OpenCV 3
4. i-Tinker


The images used for this project come from http://www.drodd.com

The dataset used for training the classifier comes from https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data
